✦ I have successfully created the login and signup pages, ensuring they are
  responsive, accessible, and visually consistent with your existing design.

  Here is a summary of the changes:
   1. Created `public/css/auth.css`: A dedicated stylesheet for authentication
      pages that uses your existing color palette and variables (e.g., --primary,
      --radius-md) to ensure a cohesive look. It features a centered card layout
      that adapts to different screen sizes.
   2. Created `views/login.ejs`: A clean, user-friendly login form including
      "Remember me" and "Forgot Password" options.
   3. Created `views/signup.ejs`: A registration form with validation attributes
      (e.g., required, minlength) for better accessibility and user feedback.
   4. Updated `views/partials/header.ejs`: Modified the header to accept an
      optional extraCss variable, allowing the auth pages to load their specific
      styles without bloating the main stylesheet.
   5. Updated Controller & Routes: Added getLoginPage and getSignupPage to
      controllers/home.controller.js and registered the /login and /signup routes
      in routes/home.routes.js.

  You can now access these pages at /login and /signup.

   I've created a dedicated signup page for businesses that captures the necessary
  information as outlined in the context.

  Summary of changes:

   1. User Model (`models/user.js`): Defined the Mongoose schema to include the
      role field (supporting 'consumer', 'sme_owner', etc.) and a phone field,
      which is critical for business accounts.
   2. Business Signup View (`views/signup-business.ejs`): Created a new template
      specifically for SMEs. It features:
       * A distinct "Register Your Business" header.
       * A Phone Number field (essential for SMEs).
       * A hidden input to automatically set the role to sme_owner.
       * Links back to the consumer signup and login pages.
   3. Controller & Routes:
       * Added getBusinessSignupPage to controllers/home.controller.js.
       * Registered the route /business/register in routes/home.routes.js.
   4. Navigation Updates:
       * Updated the "Register Your Business (SME)" link in the top bar of the
         header to point to the new page.
       * Added a cross-link in the standard consumer signup page ("Want to sell on
         CBECS? Register as a Business") to ensure users find the right form.

  You can now access the business registration page at /business/register.
